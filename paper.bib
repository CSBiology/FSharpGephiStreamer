  abstract = {Gephi is an open source software for graph and network analysis. It uses a 3D render engine to display large networks in real-time and to speed up the exploration. A flexible and multi-task architecture brings new possibilities to work with complex data sets and produce valuable visual results. We present several key features of Gephi in the context of interactive exploration and interpretation of networks. It provides easy and broad access to network data and allows for spatializing, filtering, navigating, manipulating and clustering. Finally, by presenting dynamic features of Gephi, we highlight key aspects of dynamic network visualization.},

  title = {Leveraging .NET meta-programming components from F#: integrated queries and interoperable heterogeneous execution},
  year = {2006},
  month = {January},
  abstract = {Language-integrated meta-programming and extensible compilation have been recurring themes of programming languages since the invention of LISP. A recent real-world application of these techniques is the use of small meta-programs to specify database queries, as used in the Microsoft LINQ extensions for .NET. It is important that .NET languages such as F# are able to leverage the functionality provided by LINQ and related components for heterogeneous execution, both for pragmatic reasons and as a first step toward applying more disciplined, formal approaches to these problems. This paper explores the use of a modest meta-programming extension to F# to access and leverage the functionality of LINQ and other components. We do this by demonstrating an implementation of language integrated SQL queries using the LINQ/SQLMetal libraries. We also sketch two other applications: the execution of data-parallel quoted F# programs on a GPU via the Accelerator libraries, and dynamic native-code compilation via LINQ.},
